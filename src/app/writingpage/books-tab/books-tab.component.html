<p class="pLeft">I've been reading and telling stories for my entire life. When I was a little kid, I would rope my friends into these grand imaginary adventures, running around the school playground, or a backyard, pretending the trees were some enchanted forest brimming with danger and excitement. Cherished books got me through droughts of boredom as a child, and kept me company on long boat trips across the Atlantic ocean. The Wind in the Willows, Watership Down, The Lord of The Rings, and other such stories will live forever in my heart alongside memories of squirreling myself away in little cubbies and cozy spaces below deck, turning pages to the smell of salty sea water as the waves swayed me this way and that. </p>

        You're more than welcome to check out my Goodreads if you're curious what books I've read, or plan on reading, or what I thought of a certain book. I'll warn you of two things first, though. 1) It is not my first instinct to go to Goodreads and rate a book the moment I'm finished with it, which means this list by no means contains every book I've ever read. 2) Any book I find myself incapable of putting down gets 5 stars. Books I find myself able to put down... Sometimes don't get picked up again. This selection bias means that I hand out a lot of 5 star ratings.

<p class="center">It's hard to say exactly when I started taking my writing seriously. I had a few good attempts at getting started when I was around 14 or 15 - deeply flawed stories, of course, but coherent and with all the right pieces. I would typically make it some 10,000 words in before I lost the thread to inexperience and lack of planning, and my - then unknown - ADHD made me give up. I took those ideas very seriously at the time, but I was never so invested in my own work as I am now. If you pinned me down and forced me to give you a date, I would say I started writing in earnest at the beginning of 2021. But the ideas for those works predate the first words in their prologues by at least four or five years, reaching all the way back to when I started designing my own tabletop RPG system in around 2015-2016, spurred by a rising frustration with D&D 5th edition</p>

<p>When my tabletop rulebook reached 170 pages of condensed, bullet-pointed rules, I realized I couldn’t go much further without playtesters. So, I started trying to rope my friends into test sessions. Unfortunately, I discovered the enthusiasm just wasn’t there in other people like it was for me. One day, a good friend suggested that the problem might be a lack of attachment to the setting. Dungeons & Dragons, you see, is a familiar, famous, and fantastical setting that almost everyone knows enough about to at least be interested in learning more. My system had lore, and a setting, and some stories and characters, but they were all in the background - nobody knew anything about them. So, I decided to shelf the game for a little while and work, instead, on some books, really just to help me flesh out the setting a bit more, so that I could get people hooked.</p>

<p>I sat down and started to really think about the universe my game was set in, the physics and geography, why things were the way that they were - and this led me to designing from the ground up. A metaphysics-first approach. What’s the fabric of this universe? What’s it all made of, and how does it interact to create physical space? My notes document grew, and grew, and grew, and now sits at 99 pages of shorthand notes documenting everything from constructed languages to the nature of time and space. One day I realized I had created a setting so robust that it could surprise me, its own creator, with the way the rules I had created interacted. I was <b>discovering</b> things about my own world. That was when I knew I had something special.</p>

<p>So I started to think of some stories. I created a world in this universe, and detailed its origins and timeline in broad strokes. The first story that came to my mind was compelling, but took place too late in the world’s timeline - I needed something a bit earlier, to serve as a good introduction to the setting. I considered what I knew of storytelling devices and decided that a proper, classical Hero’s Journey, in the style of Homer or Tolkien, was exactly what I needed my first book to be. The single character perspective would help me get used to writing, and help the audience orient themselves in this strange, alien world. The familiar narrative structure would comfort people as they dove into the deep complexities of my universe. It was such a perfect idea. So perfect, in fact, that only 20,000 words in I became convinced that it was <b>too</b> perfect to be my first attempt at writing a book.</p>

<p>So, I shelved that, too. In fact, I shelved the entire primary world I had created - the world that would serve as the setting for my tabletop RPG, when I got back around to it - and created several other worlds instead, with which to introduce people to the metaphysics and consistent themes of my universe. Worlds I could play around in with my writing, until I felt I was ready - as a storyteller - to tell my more important and profound stories. And that was how I came to write 80,000 words of mystery/horror as my first foray into novel writing.</p>
