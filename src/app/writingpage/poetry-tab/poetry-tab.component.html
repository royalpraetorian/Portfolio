    <p class="paragraph">I started taking poetry seriously in middle school, where I would write little poems on torn up squares of paper, fold them up, and leave them lying around in classrooms for teachers or other students to find. I had these dreams of becoming some anonymous, mysterious school poet. Apparently a teacher found a couple of them, and immediately recognized my handwriting - so much for the mystery poet. But I've continued to write poetry, and I've tried to always improve. Poetry for me is a process I cannot force; the poem has to come to me, and I get a tiny little window in which to work on it, before the magic is gone for the rest of the day and any attempt to force myself to keep working on it results in disappointment. So poetry, for me, is a lengthy process. Many of my poems remain unfinished for years until that flash of inspiration hits again in just the right way. I'll let you see a couple little bits and pieces - if you want to try to finish them yourself, you're welcome to. Art, after all, belongs to no one. These ideas are islands, and just because I arrived here first gives me no right to stake any sort of claim to them. Besides, I think I see older footprints in the sand anyway.</p>

            <p>How am I supposed to leave after that?</p>
            <p>When I sat beside you in the car and</p>
            <p>The music was my bones, the thrum,</p>
            <p>Filled me with the life, the pulse,</p>
            <p>Of some enviable stranger, some rhythm</p>
            <p>Foreign to me, a good friend of my desire,</p>
            <p>Like you - stranger than I desire, but no stranger,</p>
            <p>To my eyes.</p>

            I wrote this poem after spending some time with someone I didn't yet know I had fallen madly in love with. They drove me home with their roommates in the back seat, playing music so loud I could feel it shaking my bones. I've always been the quiet sort, and to see them all dressed up and beautiful, and putting their own fun before the convinience of others - well, without passing any moral judgement it was like watching someone close live out the sort of life I'd only ever seen in stories. Getting out of that car was incredibly difficult.

            <p><br>In shadow of distant rocky Phobos’ twin</p>
            <p>A round, blue man reclined, portly and myopic,</p>
            <p>for whom the boundary of shade eluded sight</p>
            <p>and thus by lack of contrast he mistook gloom</p>
            <p>for all that anything could be.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>A wisp from his pipe curled quizzically</p>
            <p>Toward me, bittersweet and tempting.</p>
            <p>It’s scent some long forgotten succor,</p>
            <p>spurious and guilty, but painted blush</p>
            <p>And pretty to the mind.</p>

            This one isn't quite finished yet, but I think these first two stanzas are the most important ones. The rest of the poem will come to me someday, I think about it often enough. I'm rather proud of the flow and sound of it, and so I have to make sure the rest of it matches up to that same level of quality. I hope the metaphor is obvious enough that I don't have to explain it?

                        Today I watched a bird hang motionless in the air,<br>
                        Flapping in vain against the wind it seemed stuck.<br>
                        I took the train downtown but as above, so below;<br>
                        There was nothing for me there, back I came to where I started.<br>

                        I reached for you, I strained myself as far as I could, I stood on my toes,<br>
                    Unsteady, I touched those clouds, I made a little hole for the sun to come through.<br>
                    But today the moon was up by noon, and the sun hid behind the mountains.<br>
                    As above so below, you didn’t smile when I told you I love you.<br>

                    A sheet of grey clouds blanketed this sullen valley, as above, so below,<br>
                        Like the dirty snow on the ground, stretched thin but unbroken,<br>
                        Like cotton pulled apart halfway. It blocked out the sun;<br>
                        It was cold in the shade - I rolled up my sleeves.<br>

                    I’ll sit in the shade now I think, with my sleeves rolled up.<br>
                I know I can’t reach those clouds anymore, I know the sun will blind me,<br>
                Like your smile, I must be unworthy. Like that bird beneath the clouds,<br>
                I think I’ll stay right here, the others are playing in the sun, and there’s nothing for me there.<br>

                There’s nothing for me here. The sun peeks through from time to time,<br>
                    It warms me and I think if I could reach those clouds I could pull them apart.<br>
                    If I could reach them, but I know I never will. If I could reach them, but I fear,<br>
                    The sun would blind me if I let it through - as above, so below - like your smile.<br>

            This one is a bit dismal, which makes sense as it was written during a pretty long and trying depressive episode. There's a couple of motifs here that I <i>felt</i> more than reasoned, so I would have a difficult time explaining them - but I think that's for the best. I think the gist of this poem comes across pretty readily, there's not a lot of fanciness going on here. It's really a meditation on resignation as a coping mechanism.
            <br><br>
            At the end of the day, I'm not sure I agree with this poem anymore - but then, I'm not the same person who wrote it. Depression really alters your perspective considerably when you're in the thick of it. Like the Ship of Theseus, a different mind produced this poem, and truth is subjective. I remember feeling as though there was a great deal of truth in this at the time.
