    <p>The best criticism comes from a place of love. I really love Dungeons & Dragons. Yes, a great deal of its lore is cobbled-together references and rehashes of various other mythologies, fictions, and inspirations, but with this 'lack of originality' in many places (although don't misunderstand me, D&D certainly has its own unique lore aspects) comes a feeling of familiarity and comfort that makes the game so very easy to slip into. We all know, thanks to Tolkien, what an elf or a dwarf is. We're familiar with goblins, and orcs, and of course dragons. It seems as though any creature from myth or folk tale that isn't already a part of the monster manual can fit pretty easily into the setting.
    <br><br>
    But I mentioned criticism, and I do indeed have a lot of it for D&D. As of the latest edition, 5e, the rules are remarkably simple and minimalist. This makes the game easy to learn for first-timers, but places a hefty burden on the game master. Systems like crafting are missing entirely, meaning if a player desires to make something within the game, the GM must often come up with rules on the spot.</p>

            My Primary Grievances with Dungeons and Dragons
        </mat-card-title>
        <mat-card-content>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Lack of Systems.</b> D&D offers an incredibly barebones experience, highly driven by roleplay and the absurdity its available systems allow for. D&D is often a comedy first, and an adventure second.</li>
                <li><b>Magic Ruins Puzzle Solving.</b> Spells like Zone of Truth, detection spells, and the ability to cure any disease or poison with a single spell slot, offer players tools that do not <i>enhance</i> their puzzle-solving experience, but rather <i>circumvent it entirely</i>. This can be incredibly frustrating as a GM, when you're trying to write a story that heavily encorporates an element players are essentially allowed to skip, but it can also make the game very boring to players, by often entirely removing any and all non-combat challenges.</li>
                <li><b>Direct Healing Spoils Drama.</b> The ease with which damage is healed in Dungeons and Dragons - often times immediately after it is taken - takes a lot of the threat and excitement out of being hit.</li>

    <p>My frustrations with Dungeons and Dragons came to a head in 5th edition, back in 2015-2016, when I was GMing a campaign for some friends. I spent a great deal of time fleshing out a living world of sorts, with loose plot lines (because you can never predict what your players will do) but a great deal of focus on characters and history. This way, no matter where my players went or how they decided to tackle a situation, I had a wealth of information with which to imrpovise as scenario. If they did something unexpected, I could often adapt fairly easy because I knew the history, and I knew the motivations and personalities of the NPCs, so finding the proper outcome was often akin to solving an equation. But, despite all my hard work, things began to unravel. 
    <br><br>    
    Detect Good and Evil quickly did away with any ambiguity, when players encountered a shady NPC who they had to decide whether or not to trust. I have to wonder if the detective genre exists in the world of D&D, or if every book in that category is one page of the main character casting Zone of Truth. A disease meant to be a major plot point was undone by a wave of the party cleric's hand. It seemed the only threads I could challange the party with involved direct physical threats and combat. Combat can certainly be fun, but if it's the only way to drive a plot things get a bit flat. Add to that, with a decent healer in the party combat is often forgotten the moment it's over - unless something spectacular happens - and you get an experience driven largely by banter, jokes, and absurdity, which can be intensely enjoyable for what it is - but isn't always what I'm looking for in a tabletop roleplaying experience.</p>

            Goals and Guiding Principles for a New System
        </mat-card-title>
        <mat-card-content>
            <ol>
                <li><b>A Healthy Balance of Realism and Fantasy.</b> I've always enjoyed historical accuracy, but I learned a while ago that it can't ever be the highest priority. In designing this system I aimed for subsystems that are reflective of the real world, but I made adjustments where needed to avoid bloat, overcomplication, or boredom.</li>
                <li><b>Risk and Drama.</b> Damage sticks to characters in my system, in the form of wounds that may require treatment and can affect them for an entire campaign. The removal of direct, instant healing means that even victories can carry consequences. This places the party in a state of collective struggle, which can deepen bonds and enhance the thrill of a roleplaying experience.</li>
                <li><b>Tools, not Solutions.</b> My answer to mechanics like Zone of Truth and direct healing is to offer players tools that, if used creatively or skillfully, can be used to solve their problems, but will never outright give them the solution. Direct healing, for example, has been substituted for an entire medicinal subsystem which requires players to make decisions about <i>how</i> they want to treat a wound.</li>

    <p>So I set out to make my own tabletop system. Inspired by my love of Historical European Martial Arts, and my overactive imagination, I created a setting and got to work defining rules. At the beginning I was just pulling apart D&D's rules and modifying them to suit my purposes. But, as I continued and my understanding of game design grew, I started to draw inspiration from other tabletop games, and I began to create my own unique subsystems as well. I found creative solutions for problems. The entire process was an exercise in dialectics. I would sit down to flesh out the cooking subsystem, for example, and dive deep into cullinary theory, trying to break it down into components that could be gamified. Then I would look at my work and realize it was far too bloated and overcomplicated - but what to cut? And so I would move on to the next system, and let that problem stew in the back of my mind for a few days, until finally the synthesis between realism and fun occurred to me.</p>

    <p>Now my no-fluff, condensed rules document is 170 pages long. I've placed this project on the backburner for now, but I still work on it every now and then when the mood strikes me. I intend to return to it and finish it as soon as I can find a couple groups of playtesters to help me explore the problems my system might have. When it's finished, I plan to release the whole thing for free. I want everyone to be able to enjoy this game I've made - and most of all I want to play it with lots of people!</p>
